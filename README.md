## Why a Scroll To Index behavior is not straightforward 
Because we need to do the implementation of the ScrollController in our widget and develop the logic behind..

## Approach taken to solve the challenge
First of all i read the info about the challenge... then i started with the definition of the classes that i was going to use, after that i define all the structure of the app, the folders that i was going to use along the project and the screens that i was going to need.
